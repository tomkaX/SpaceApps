# SpaceApps



This site has multiple modules, including a lot of SVG and CSS animations, a custom terminal (with even more animations and effects), a real time ticketing system, a real time dashboard system integrated with the venue, and even a full-blown multiplayer shooter game integrated into the site.

Every single component has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, using io.js for the backend and Socket.io for real time interactions.

The  Site, Game and Dashboards were developed by Aerolab.
