This site has multiple modules, including a lot of SVG and CSS animations, a custom terminal (with even more animations and effects), a real time ticketing system, a real time dashboard system integrated with the venue, and even a full-blown multiplayer shooter game integrated into the site.

Every single component has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, using io.js for the backend and Socket.io for real time interactions.
